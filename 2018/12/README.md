# Azure DevOps Hands-On Lab Part 1

## Prerequisites
Please make sure your device is ready with the following prerequisites:
1. Azure DevOps Account
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Git

### Azure DevOps Account
You should create an [Azure DevOps Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) at https://devops.azure.com.  This requires a Microsoft account.

#### Microsoft Account creation
Many of our attendees have Microsoft accounts. You can sign in at [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com).  If you do not have one, you can create one at [signup.microsoft.com] (https://signup.live.com).

Please note you can use ANY email address for a Microsoft account.  So use whatever account you have access to and is convenient for you.

### Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Visual Studio Code is a free cross-platform editor.  Extensions will allow you to use Azure DevOps effectively.

## Git Installation

### Determine your current Git version
You may determine if you have Git installed and ready to go for this lab by simply opening a Command Prompt or Powershell prompt and typing:

    git --version

If this returns output similar to `git version 2.17.1` or `git version 2.17.1.windows.2` (on Windows), then Git is already installed and ready to use in this lab.  This likely also means this is in your system PATH so that it can be used from anywhere you desire.
