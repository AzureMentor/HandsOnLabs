# Git Tools Hands-On Lab

## Prerequisites
Please make sure your device is ready with the following prerequisites:

### Git
You will need Git installed and ready to use from the command prompt or Powershell to follow along with this lab.

This lab installation guide covers Windows, but anyone with Git installed should be able to follow along on any OS.

*(We will add Ubuntu Linux instructions before the lab, and we would accept help for Mac users with a pull request!)*

This lab will not use any other tools.  Future labs will cover IDE integration and tools.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code will be covered in this lab

### GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop can be installed from: https://desktop.github.com/

### GitKraken by AxoSoft
GitKraken can be downloaded from: https://www.gitkraken.com/

## Determine your current Git version
You may determine if you have Git installed and ready to go for this lab by simply opening a Command Prompt or Powershell prompt and typing:

    git --version

If this returns output similar to `git version 2.17.1` or `git version 2.17.1.windows.2` (on Windows), then Git is already installed and ready to use in this lab.  This likely also means this is in your system PATH so that it can be used from anywhere you desire.

As of this writing, we recommend that Windows developers have at least 2.17.1(2) installed because of this security vulnerability disclosure: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/05/29/announcing-the-may-2018-git-security-vulnerability/
